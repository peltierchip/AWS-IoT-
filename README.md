This programmable Wi-Fi button is designed to help developers learn how to use AWS IoT, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Simple Notification Service and other Amazon Web Services.
An easy way to get started with the Internet of Things, based on the Amazon Dash button hardware, the AWS IoT button is a developer kit that can be programmed to control internet-connected devices and services.
Eliminate the hassle of writing device-specific code; code in the cloud to configure your buttonâ€™s single, double, and long clicks.
Connect the AWS IoT Button to services in the AWS Cloud with a single click.

For 3D printer attachment, 3D print a mount to secure it to your base to house the Pi Cam.
Highly recommanded to get a longer ribbon cable to connect it to your Pi Cam.

Future updates: Integration with Telegram bot for even easier monitoring or deploy it by scaling it up (eg school or industrial level)


Special thanks to Poni, Ziqi, Prof Tee Hui and AWS
